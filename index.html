  <h5>Background</h5>
   
	<div class="section">
   		<div id="box1" style="width: 60%; height: auto; margin-top: -15px;float: left;">
   			<p>Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) causes a slight but noticeable decline in mental abilities, such as memory loss and impaired thinking. People with MCI have a much higher risk of going on to develop dementia.<p>
   			<p>Previous research has shown that regular exercise may help improve brain health and prevent dementia. This study is comparing the effectiveness of three different kinds of exercise on memory and thinking abilities.</p>
